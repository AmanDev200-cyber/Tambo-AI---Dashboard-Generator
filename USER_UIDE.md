## 1. Introduction

**Tambo AI – Generative Dashboard Generator** is a web-based analytics application that helps users turn structured data into interactive dashboards using artificial intelligence.

The application is designed for:
- Students learning data analysis
- Hackathon judges reviewing projects
- First-time users exploring analytics tools

```
## 6. Generating Dashboards
```text
After uploading data, users can generate dashboards using natural language.

Example Prompt
Show me churn risk for Q3
What Happens Internally
The system reads dataset structure

AI interprets user intent

Visualizations are selected based on data types

A dashboard is generated automatically

No manual chart configuration is required.
```
## 7. Interacting with Dashboards
```text
Once generated, dashboards may include:

Interactive charts

Filters for categories or ranges

Sliders for simple what-if simulations

Hover tooltips for additional details

All interactions update in real time based on available data.
```

```
## 10. Mobile & Responsive Behavior
```
The interface adapts to smaller screens

Charts stack vertically on mobile devices

Panels collapse to maintain readability

11. Best Practices for Better Results
Use descriptive column names (e.g., customer_id, churn_status)

Avoid mixing text and numbers in the same column

Upload clean, well-structured data

Write clear and specific prompts

Focus on one analytical goal per prompt
```
## 12. Current Limitations
```Single dataset upload only

No live database connections

Limited advanced statistical modeling

No export to PDF or PowerPoint

Requires manual refresh after re-uploading data
